    This app utilizes data from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/), a project that focuses on the impact of Airbnb on residential communities. The data was last updated on March 6, 2023. Future updates to the app will be contingent upon new, comparable data releases.

    ### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
    This app is an independent project and serves as an exploratory tool. While it aims to provide valuable insights, it is not a substitute for professional advice and nuanced understanding of individual listings.
